// Given an array arr[] of distinct elements size N that is sorted and then rotated around an unknown point, the task is to check if the array has a pair with a given sum X.

// Examples : 

// Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10}, X = 16
// Output: true
// Explanation: There is a pair (6, 10) with sum 16

// Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, X = 35
// Output: true
// Explanation: There is a pair (26, 9) with sum 35
